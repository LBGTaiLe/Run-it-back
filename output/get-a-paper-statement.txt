There are a couple of ways you can order a paper statement by post. Or you can print a statement yourself. 
























I use Online for Busines



Do you have a printer? 
It’s quicker to print a statement yourself. In Statement options, select Monthly PDFs. From here you can download and print the statement you need. 
Use Search your statement to show only certain transactions. Then select Statement options, then Print current view.
