 Inappropriate behaviour. 
 We don't stand for inappropriate behaviour at Lloyds Bank. This applies equally to colleagues, customers, clients and suppliers. It includes: 
 
 actions. 
 things that are said. 
 things that are written down. 
 
 Any behaviour that has a negative impact on you is inappropriate. It doesn't have to be intentional, overt or abusive. 
 If you witness such behaviour from one of our colleagues, please report it. You can do this by raising a complaint. 
 We're also asking our colleagues to report any inappropriate behaviour they witness while doing their jobs.
