If you don’t trust your device then we’ll ask you to use your card reader every time.             I’ve trusted my browser, but I keep getting asked to trust it again. Why is this?                                  expandable section            You may be asked to trust your device again if something has changed such as;   you have cleared your cookies  you are using private browsing  we see unusual logon activity on your account  other people have used the same device to logon to their Online for Business account.

This means we’ll usually only ask you for three characters from your memorable information, as well as your password, each time you log on.  Sometimes we may ask you to use your Card Reader, so it’s a good idea to always have one to hand.                                         How to logon      Memorable information      Trusting your device      Using your Card Reader                     How your card reader works  Card readers generate unique, one-time passcodes used to help identify you and to confirm some of your online banking activities, especially payments.  We’ll prompt you each time you need to use it. Simple on-screen instructions will always guide you through the steps to take.  Your card reader holds no personal information about you and does not need to be connected to a computer.

Your audio card reader will time out and turn off after 90 seconds of inactivity. To reactivate it, simply remove and reinsert your card into the reader.  When pressing a key on the audio card reader, always ensure that you hear the voice prompt before pressing another key. Keys pressed during the voice prompts are not recognised by the reader.  To repeat a voice prompt, press the 'clear' button.  When the audio function is switched off, you can press the '0' key to increase the size of the unique eight-digit code generated by the audio card reader. When the audio function is switched on, press '0' repeatedly to hear the code repeated back to you one number at a time. A single 'beep' will tell you when you reach the end of the code.                     Frequently asked questions                                  expandable section                       1.
